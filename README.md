A React Nav Demo

Dynamically loads all Page Components that are exported from Pages.js.  It puts all of them in the Nav, and can have order and NavText controlled by the PagesNavText  object in Pages.js.

I have included a production build that you can see here:


This was built with create-react-app.  Developed further from https://github.com/Frazer/meteor-react-nav , which originally was inspired by https://codepen.io/trey/post/tabbed-navigation-react
